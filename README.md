# AmberGreen Carbon Footprint Calculator

AmberGreen is an AI-powered application designed to calculate, monitor, and predict the carbon footprint of state-owned buildings. It provides actionable recommendations to help institutions reduce their environmental impact while leveraging AI and prediction models for better insights.

## Features

### üîç Carbon Footprint Calculation
- Calculates carbon emissions based on monthly utility consumption (electricity, water, heating, etc.).

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Recommendations
- Uses **Ollama's Llama3.1** AI integration to generate actionable recommendations for reducing carbon emissions.

### üìà Carbon Footprint Prediction
- Employs a **modified version of Prophet** to forecast future emissions based on historical utility consumption data.

### üë• User Roles
- **Institution Users**:
  - Log in to input monthly utility consumption data.
  - View detailed reports and AI-generated recommendations.
- **Guest Users**:
  - View the carbon footprint of state-owned buildings (read-only access).

### üóÇÔ∏è Data Storage
- **PostgreSQL** is used for storing user data and utility consumption records.

### üíª Frontend & Backend
- **Frontend**: Built using **Kivy**.
- **Backend**: Powered by **Python**.

## Current Status

AmberGreen is currently in **demo mode** and requires running directly from an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
